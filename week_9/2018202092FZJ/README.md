Because the data folder and thulac folder are too large (about 3.4G) to upload to github, only the source code of the search engine is uploaded.

Data folder contains processed title and body and file_list.txt. Search engine initialization is done by file_list.txt.

The thulac folder contains model.

Usage:

make

If not initialized,input./seachengine init.Initialization will take a very long long long time,please wait patiently.

Then input the words you want to find,view the top 10 results.

If initialization is completed,input ./searchengine and follow the above.
