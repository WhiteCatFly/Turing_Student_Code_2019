This homework is much easier to finish than the previous.

This program can workout high-precision integer calculation with addition, subtraction and multiplication.
Actually this work is very similar to the "Double Simulator" in the last term. So the division and modulo is emmmmmm...... (pigeon yakking)
Focus on the new grammers learned about class in class.
Especially keyword "explicit" is first used.
Operator is widely used.

Completely accepted by all the test cases.
Hopes no bugs 2333333.

That's it.
