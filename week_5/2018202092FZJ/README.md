BigInteger.h contains the definition of the class, and the BigInteger contains the definition of functions in the class. 
Assert is used in the origin test.cpp to test whether it works properly.Then the teaching assistant offered main.cpp to see the results directly(And I submit test.cpp to check.).Users can change test files to verify that the results of different input methods are correct.The results are printed on the screen and printed to the print.out at the same time.The results are same as those offered by the teaching assistant.
